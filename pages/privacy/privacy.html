          <p>Pepper is a food company. Our platform is intended to provide a seamless experience for creating, sharing, and discovering food from around the world and interacting with the chefs behind that food.
          <br><br>When you use Pepper, you’ll share information with us so we can enhance your personal and community-wide experience on the platform. We want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, where we use it, whom we share it with, and how you can customize your privacy choices to ensure your maximum comfort with the extent of the information you share.
          <br><br>That leads us to our Privacy Policy. We’ve composed our policy in a way that’s refreshingly free of the complicated legal jargon that overwhelms typical privacy policies. We want you to spend more time cooking and buttering up your friend’s meals and less time searching for how your information is being used.
          <br><br>So we’ve done our best to make our policy clear, concise, and respectful of your privacy. Of course, if you still have any questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just contact us.</p>

          <h2>Children</h2>
          <p>Pepper simply is not intended for anyone under 13 to use independently. Food is fun, and we want everyone to enjoy its many benefits. And we provide a platform to add to your enjoyment of it. However, we believe the functions of a social media platform extend beyond just sharing food, and we want to ensure every user is of an age capable of understanding the full depth of a social media platform. We do not restrict users from making accounts with older family members to enjoy the many positives Pepper has to offer. However, we never direct or intend our platform for children. Simple.</p>
          <p>In addition, we may limit how we collect and use some of the information of EU users between 13 and 16. We may be unable to provide certain functionality to these users due to age restrictions. If we must rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent’s consent before we collect and use that information.</p>

          <p>If you’re a user in the European Union, you should know that Pepper is the controller of your personal information. Here is some additional information we would like to bring to your attention:
        <br><br>
      <b>Rights of Access, Deletion, Correction, and Portability</b>
    <br>
    You can exercise your rights of access, deletion, correction, and portability as described in the Control over Your Information section above.
</p>
<p>
  <b> Bases for Using Your Information </b>
  <br>Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply. These conditions are called “legal bases”, and they are as described below...
</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Consent.</b> In some cases, we will ask for your permission to use your information for specific purposes. If you grant it, we will provide you the option to revoke that permission at any time through the app or your device.</li>
        <li><b>Contract.</b> We use your information because you’ve entered into an agreement with us. For example, when we share your Recipe in Explore, it is only if you have previously agreed to publizing your profile. If your profile is private, we will never share it with anyone you have not purposefully shared it with</li>
        <li><b>Legal Obligation.</b> We may be required by law or valid legal processes to use your personal information. We will notify Chefs when we receive legal process requests seeking their account information, with few exceptions.</li>
        <li><b>Legitimate interest.</b> We may use your information because we, or a third party, has legitimate interest in doing so. For example, we may use your information to provide and enhance our platform such as posting Recipes, sending friend requests, providing customer support, and personalizing ads. Regardless, our interests never outweigh your right to privacy so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think the way we are using your data in no way infringes on or significantly impacts your privacy in any way more than expected of you.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Your Right to Object</b><br><br>

You can perform these actions in the app or on your device. If there are other types of information you don’t agree with us processing, you can contact us.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>International Transfers</b><br><br>
      We may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live. Whenever we share information of EU users outside the EU we make sure an adequate transfer mechanism is in place.
